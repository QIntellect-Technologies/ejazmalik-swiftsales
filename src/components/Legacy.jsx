                            In 2003, product distribution in our area was not good. There were no systems and no temperature control. Clients had to wait days for simple deliveries. I saw this as a big problem that needed to be fixed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We started with just one small van and three people. The early days were very hard. Roads were bad and people did not want to change. But we had one rule: <strong>"If we say we will deliver, we deliver."</strong>

                            By 2012, that one van became many. SWIFT SALES DISTRIBUTER became a proper company. We were the first to use computers to track our stock. We did not just follow others; we set new standards.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today, after 20 years, our biggest success is not money. It is the trust of a partner in a small village who knows that when he places an order, Swift Sales has already delivered the product. That trust is our real story.
